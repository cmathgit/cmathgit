# Recent Projects & Notable Accomplishments

## **Oracle Integration & OCI Optimization**
Design and support Integration solutions for Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suiteâ€”including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SCM), and Human Capital Management (HCM)â€”via Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC). These integrations utilize various tech stacks, programming languages, connections, and tools with secure access to the organizationâ€™s ERP system and cloud databases. Technologies include: SFTP, SOAP, REST, SQLcl, ATP Databases, BI Publisher, PL/SQL, Java, and XML Schemas. Delivered multiple enterprise-grade solutions in Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) integrating external healthcare systems with Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP. These projects showcase advanced skills in cloud-native integration, data staging, REST/SOAP APIs, and cost-efficient infrastructure management. 

### 1. **Capital Budget Integration**  
   - Designed to process capital budget data transferred from an external Healthcare EPM system into the Oracle ERP system.   
   - Data received as a pipe delimited file via SFTP and processes using Oracle FBDI for Project Management.   
   - Data staged using ATP newly created and uniquely tailored database tables, enriched via SOAP requests to the ERP, and formatted into an FBDI file for the Import Project Budgets job Oracle Fusion Project Control.  
   - Data separated into CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE control files as per Oracle recommendations. 
   - Ingested budget data from via SFTP, staged in ATP, enriched through ERP SOAP services, and submitted using FBDI for Oracle Project Control. 
   - Implemented CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE logic per Oracle standards. 

### 2. **ASN Receiving Integration**  
   - Designed to process Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN) Receiving data from an external system into the Oracle ERP system. 
   - This integration ensures accurate and timely receipt of goods data into the ERP system, supporting supply chain operations. 
   - Streamlined Advanced Shipment Notice data flow from external systems into Oracle ERP, enhancing supply chain visibility and operational accuracy. 

### 3. **Invoice Order Integration**  
   - Designed to process and submit invoice order data transferred from an external Healthcare Supply Chain Management system into the Oracle ERP system. 
   - Data received as a zipped container via SFTP and imported using RESTful services. 
   - The container includes PDF attachments and a schema file listing filenames and associated invoice numbers. 
   - The integration parses the schema file to retrieve invoice metadata, stages it in ATP database tables, and uses it to retrieve invoice IDs from ERP.   
   - The REST API endpoint for Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials requires the invoice ID for POST requests (see Create an attachment for an invoice).   
   - The integration constructs the POST request dynamically, specifying the invoice object and attachment filename stored in ephemeral memory. 
   - PDF attachments are included in the JSON payload in base64 format. Global and local fault/error handling is implemented. 
   - Parsed zipped payloads from the external Healthcare Supply Chain Management system containing PDFs and schema files. 
   - Staged metadata in ATP, resolved invoice IDs via ERP REST APIs, and submitted attachment POST requests with dynamic payload construction and robust fault handling. 

### 4. **OCI PaaS Optimization Project**  
   - Reduced infrastructure costs by optimizing the OCI PaaS configuration for lower environments.  
   - Minimizing uptime of non-production components. 
   - Reducing the number of active OIC Connectivity Agents in Test environments. 
   - Automating shutdown/startup schedules for OIC and ATP instances during off-hours. 
   - Maintaining DR environments in standby mode, activating only for production backups or disaster recovery events. 
   - These efforts significantly lowered compute costs while maintaining operational readiness. 

## AI Engineering \& Optimization Specialist: BibliVal Benchmark \& Cost-Effective LLM Integration

### Philosophy:
Advancing **secure**, **cost-effective**, and **responsible** Generative AI through retrieval-augmented generation, multi-agent orchestration, privacy-first prompting protocols, and open-source tooling. Dedicated to bridging AI engineering and security, with emphasis on adversarial robustness, confidential computing, and compliance-aware deployments across regulated domains.

### Recent Project: BibliVal Benchmark

#### **Objective**

Evaluate whether free, open-access LLMs enhanced with RAG can match premium models on specialized theological tasks requiring linguistic precision, doctrinal fidelity, and scholarly depth.

#### **Technical Implementation**

**Architecture:**

```
User Query â†’ Perplexity Web Search (domain-filtered) 
           â†’ Mistral OCR (PDF extraction) 
           â†’ Ollama Local Embedding (embeddinggemma:300m) 
           â†’ Vector Similarity Search (top-3) 
           â†’ GLM-4.5-Flash (Z.AI free API) 
           â†’ Theologically Sound Exegesis
```

**Stack:**

- **UI:** OpenWebUI (private network deployment)
- **Base LLM:** GLM-4.5-Flash (Z.AI free cloud API)
- **Embedding:** Ollama Local (embeddinggemma:300m, all-minilm:22m)

- **Search:** Perplexity API (domain-constrained, \$0.005/query vs. $0.113-$0.09/query (5K Tokens I/O))
- **Orchestration:** Python + REST API + LangChain


#### **Key Findings**

1. **Cost-Performance Validation:**
    - **GLM-4.5-Flash + RAG:** A+ performance at \$0.005/query vs. $0.113-$0.09/query (5K Tokens I/O)
    - **GPT-5 (\$20/month):** B+ performance (underperformed free model)
    - **Claude-4.5-Sonnet (\$20/month):** A+ performance (tied with free model)
    - **Annual Savings:** \$240/user (ministry context) to \$119,460/year (500-user seminary)
2. **Embedding Model Selection is Critical:**
    - **embeddinggemma:300m** â†’ A+ grade (theological orthodoxy maintained)
    - **qwen3-embedding:0.6b** â†’ C- grade (heterodox source weighting caused doctrinal compromise)
    - **Insight:** Model alignment with domain-specific values matters more than parameter count
3. **"Christian AI" Branding â‰  Superior Output:**
    - Non-Christian LLMs (Claude, GLM-4.6) produced orthodox, confessionally aligned exegesis
    - FaithGPT (Christian-branded) underperformed with instructions (B- grade: demon-focused, alarmist)
    - BibleGPT (Christian-branded) succeeded due to **domain-specific training** (GotQuestions.org, Pulpit Commentaries), not branding
4. **Domain Filtering > General Search:**
    - Restricting Perplexity search to biblegateway.com, biblehub.com, gotquestions.org eliminated heterodox source contamination
    - 3 high-quality results outperformed 5+ general results
